To view one of the reports, get it's url and plug it in to [this website](https://htmlpreview.github.io/).

For example, if our raw url is `https://github.com/krishnaglick/lighthouse-metrics/blob/main/reports/Destinations%20List%20Page%20Wed%20Nov%2016%202022%2015:29:24%20GMT-0500%20(Eastern%20Standard%20Time).html`
Then it can be previewed [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/krishnaglick/lighthouse-metrics/blob/main/reports/Destinations%20List%20Page%20Wed%20Nov%2016%202022%2015:29:24%20GMT-0500%20(Eastern%20Standard%20Time).html)
